// The computer's DRAM is split up into regions that map to different LLC sets.
//
// In order words, if two memory locations belong to different DRAM regions,
// they can never map to the same LLC line.
//
// Stripes are continuous ranges of DRAM. A region is made up of multiple
// stripes. If the cache address shift is optimal, each DRAM region is
// contiguous and has exactly one stripe. Otherwise, the stripes alternate in
// DRAM as follows.
//
// R1S1 R2S1 ... RmS1 R1S2 R2S2 ... RmS2 ... R1Sn R2Sn ... RmSn
//
// After accounting for the above, a DRAM address can be broken down into the
// following components.
//
// | unused |         bits used to address installed DRAM memory            |
// |  zero  | stripe index | region index | stripe page index | page offset |
//
// With an optimal cache address shift, the stripe index field has zero bits,
// because the region index is at the top of the DRAM address bits.
